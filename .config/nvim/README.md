# My Neovim Configuration

I'm tired of the endless configurations and ricing 🫩

So, with this iteration of the Neovim configuration, I'm trying to go as
minimal as possible and not give into the ricing temptations 🛐

> NOTE: This configuration is for the Neovim's 0.12 version and later, which is
> not yet released as of the time of writing this README.md
