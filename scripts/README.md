# Scripts

This directory contains sub-directories with various shell scripts that I use.

- [Public scripts](./public-scripts) and [private scripts](./private-scripts) are sourced to PATH.
- Feel free to read/copy/use for inspiration any script in [public scripts](./public-scripts). They're public for a reason ðŸ˜‰
- [Raycast scripts](./raycast-scripts) are sourced by [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) for their [script commands feature](https://www.raycast.com/blog/getting-started-with-script-commands).
