# This script is a simplified adaptation of the `vim-anywhere` project by
# Chris Knadler. REFERENCE: https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere
#
# This script quickly opens an Alacritty window with an empty Kakoune buffer.
# After saving and quitting, the buffer is copied into the system clipboard for
# further usage.

# Save the currently-focused application to later switch back to it.

                         -e 'end tell')
# This file will hold the result text edited by Kakoune.

# Make the compose file empty, optionally creating it if it doesn't exist.
> "$compose_file"

# Edit the compose file with Kakoune.

# Copy the contents of the compose file into the system clipboard.
cat "$compose_file" | pbcopy

# Switch back to the previous application.
